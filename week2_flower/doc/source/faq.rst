This page collects answers to commonly asked questions about Federated Learning with Flower.

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Can Flower run on Juptyter Notebooks / Google Colab?

    Yes, it can! Flower even comes with a few under-the-hood optimizations to make it work even better on Colab. Here's a quickstart example:
    
    * `Flower Quickstart (TensorFlow/Keras) <https://colab.research.google.com/github/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/quickstart_simulation/sim.ipynb>`_
    * Flower Quickstart (PyTorch): coming soon (the TensorFlow/Keras example can easily be changed to make it work with PyTorch)

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` How can I run Federated Learning on a Raspberry Pi?

    Find the `blog post about federated learning on embedded device here <https://flower.dev/blog/2020-12-16-running_federated_learning_applications_on_embedded_devices_with_flower>`_ and the corresponding `GitHub code example <https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices>`_. 

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Does Flower support federated learning on Android devices?
