      label: Implement - make it work
      options:
        - label: Implement some form of dataset loading and partitioning in a separate `dataset.py` (doesn’t have to match the paper exactly)
        - label: Implement the model in PyTorch
        - label: Write a test that shows that the model has the number of parameters mentioned in the paper
        - label: Implement the federated learning setup outlined in the paper, maybe starting with fewer clients
        - label: Plot accuracy and loss
        - label: Run it and check if the model starts to converge
  - type: checkboxes
    attributes:
      label: Align - make it converge
      options:
        - label: Implement the exact data partitioning outlined in the paper
        - label: Use the exact hyperparameters outlined in the paper
        - label: Make it converge to roughly the same accuracy that the paper states
        - label: Commit the final hyperparameters and plots
        - label: Mark the PR as ready
